Tomochain can be a leading part of this phenomenon through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture allowing for a fast, secure, frictionless payment and trusted store of value. Distributed systems have been researched in a \u201dpermissioned setting\u201d where the number of participants in the system and their identities are common knowledge. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto - \u201dproposed his celebrated \u201cblockchain protocol\u201d which attempts to achieve consensus in a permissionless setting: anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution (without getting permission from a centralized or distributed authority), and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players\u201d.

This small throughput severely hinders a wide-spread adoption of such crypto- currencies. Confirmation times: The 10 minutes Bitcoin block-time is significantly larger than network latency. Furthermore, a Bitcoin block requires 5 subsequent blocks following it so that it can be confirmed; thus it takes on average one hour for a transaction to be confirmed (with low confidence). While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). Fork Generation: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. With the motivation as mentioned above, our persistent and ultimate goal of research is to propose the consensus protocol focusing on the following key strategies:\nDouble Validation to strengthen security and reduce fork",

The voting by coin-holders is credited through a Voting DApp that allows coin-holders to send $TOMO through the smart contract mechanism.\nIn addition to the voting system which is an improvement over the current Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain, Tomochain also provides a new technique, namely Double Validation complemented with a Randomization mechanism. This new technique significantly decreases the probability of having invalid blocks in the blockchain.

Masternodes are full-nodes which maintain a copy of the blockchain, produce blocks and keep the chain consistent. It is worth noting that, Tomochain does not have miners as in the current Proof-of-Work-based blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Only masternodes can produce and validate blocks. Masternodes are selected via a voting system. The first requirement of being masternodes is to deposit 50 000 $TOMO to the Voting Smart Contract.

Tomochain engineers take responsibility to design that fair, explicit, automated and accountable reward mechanism.\nThe list of masternode candidates is dynamically sorted based on voted coins. The performance of the masternodes will be tracked and reported back to the coin holders in terms of three main metrics: CPU/Memory charts which ensure the workload of the masternodes, the number of signed blocks which indicates their work performance and the last signed block which figures out their last activity. Coin- holders, at any time, can unvote masternodes, who have  low performance, and give their votes to the other masternodes who have beter performance. Coin-holders have incentives to do that because their voted coins are seen as investment to their supported masternodes, thus they should choose a voting strategy in order to maximize their profit from the investment. This simple trick keeps the system healthy since masternodes always have to race for their position so that all weak masternodes will eventually be eliminated.
